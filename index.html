    <h1>What is Indie Animation</h1>
    <p>Indie animation refers to animated content that is created independently, outside of major studio systems, 
        often by small teams or even individual creators. These projects are typically self-funded or supported through 
        crowdfunding platforms like Patreon or Kickstarter, and they thrive on platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, 
        and streaming services that support creator-driven content. What sets indie animation apart is its creative 
        freedom—unlike mainstream productions, indie creators are not bound by corporate guidelines, allowing them to explore bold, 
        unconventional stories, experiment with unique visual styles, and represent diverse voices and experiences. 
        From comedic shorts to full-length series, indie animation spans every genre imaginable, often blending heartfelt 
        storytelling with innovative visuals.</p>

                Some standout indie animation shows include "Hazbin Hotel" by VivziePop, "Helluva Boss" by SpindleHorse Toons, 
                and "Meta Runner" by Glitch Productions. These shows not only showcase amazing animation but also demonstrate the 
                power of independent creators to build dedicated fanbases, a few, like Hazbin Hotel, and Long Gone Glutch, and 
                The Amazing Digital Circus being picked up and streamed by major networks, like Amazon, Disney, and even Netflix!

                <h2>Hazbin Hotel</h2>
                <p>Hazbin Hotel is a musical dark comedy set in Hell, created by Vivienne Medrano (VivziePop). It follows Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she tries to rehabilitate sinners and give them a second chance. With vibrant animation and Broadway-level songs, it quickly became a viral hit and a landmark in indie animation.</p>

                <h2>Helluva Boss</h2>
                <p>Set in the same universe as Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss tells a totally different story—this time focusing on the employees of a chaotic assassination company in Hell. It’s raunchy, ridiculous, and often surprisingly emotional. The show is completely self-funded and made with love by the same team as Hazbin.
